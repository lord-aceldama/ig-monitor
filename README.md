# ig-monitor
A bash script that monitors a single instagram account for changes.

# usage
replace `profilename` with the account name you wish to monitor. do not use `@profilename`
```sh
bash ig-monitor profilename
```

# checking for changes
to check archive.org for any changes, check the ig-changes.txt file.
```sh
cat ig-changes.txt
```

# future improvements
may check to see if i can monitor multiple profiles instead of just one. also look into saving profile images or html to a file.
